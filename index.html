<h3>Likes and Dislikes
<p>I enjoy many activities and aspects of life, but one of the biggest is music. Whether or not it is listening to music, reasurching famous artists and bands, playing music, writing music, or singing music, I enjoy it all. I guess you could call me a music junkie.</p>
<p2>Although I enjoy a lot, I also dislike some activities. I do not enjoy fishing or anything that involves fish. I love swimming in the ocean and doing lake activities (canoeing, kayaking, paddleboarding, tubing, ext), but it takes me a lot to not have the fish bother me. I don't really understand why fish bother me so much, they just do for some reason.</p2>
